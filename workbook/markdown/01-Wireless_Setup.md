# Git Workshop Instructions

## WiFi for Demos
We may try to use a private network today (without port blocking or restrictions) to share code amongst ourselves. I've brought along a small WiFi device that can handle 30-50 people, but won't give us Internet access. That's alright though as we aren't going to use the 'net much.

Please ensure you can sign on to the following wireless network:

Wireless SSID:
    AI-MOBILE
Password:
    students
    
Additionally, try to connect to my laptop (ping it), as I'll host some repos there.  My notebook IP address is:
    10.0.1.2

## Handouts
These instructions are downloadable at GitHub from, of all things, a Git repo:
[http://github.com/matthewmccullough/git-workshop](http://github.com/matthewmccullough/git-workshop)

You don't need Git to download them though. GitHub has a download link at the top of each page that lets you get the files in ZIP format without a client Git tool.

## Bookmarks
Matthew maintains a list of interesting (hand-picked) resources about Git tools, features, releases, and uses.  These bookmarks are updated weekly and can be [found on Delicious](http://delicious.com/matthew.mc).
