# The Git Workshop Setup Instructions
We're looking forward to having you in the Git workshop. To maximize the learning and value of our time together, we ask that you prepare your notebook that you're bringing to this very hands on workshop.

## Install Git
Please have Git installed prior to attending the workshop. There's no need to "configure it" beyond the basic install. Installation instructions can be found via slides:

and via operating-system specific pages at:

http://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/
http://help.github.com/linux-git-installation/


## Establish a GitHub Account
Please create a free GitHub account if you don't already have one. We'll have every student use their username and password during class to perform a pull request.


## Contact me
I'm looking forward to having you join me for an intense and hands-on session of learning Git.  If you have any brief setup questions prior to class, just email me, Matthew McCullough, at matthewm@ambientideas.com.
